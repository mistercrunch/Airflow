``get_conn`` will no more open connection to distant host, it implies the following changes:

- it will not return a shell_id anymore (instead it will return a winrm Protocol object)
- the ``client`` property is removed
- if you used the ``winrm_protocol`` property, you'll have to call ``open_shell`` since it's not done by the get_conn
